# Laptop-Price-Predict-with-ML

I've developed a web application using Python and machine learning that predicts the price of laptops based on user-provided input parameters, including RAM, weight, manufacturer, laptop type, operating system, CPU, and GPU. This application employs a machine learning model trained on a dataset of laptops with known prices and corresponding features. Users input their desired laptop specifications, and the model generates a predicted price, making it a valuable tool for informed laptop purchasing decisions. This web app combines technology and data science to provide a user-friendly solution for estimating laptop prices based on individual preferences and requirements.
